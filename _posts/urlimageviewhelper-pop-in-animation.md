[UrlImageViewHelper](/UrlImageViewHelper) will fill an ImageView with an image that is found at a URL. Loading image from a url
into and showing it in a ImageView is nearly ubiquitous amongst Android apps. For example, most social media clients have this
functionality for profile pictures, photos, etc.
This library makes the download and display easy.

How you normally load a url into an ImageView with the library:

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(imageView, "http://example.com/image.png");
```

More polished apps will show a simple animation, generally a scale or pop in, as the image finishes loading.
It's a nice touch and users will appreciate it. Here's how you can do that with the UrlImageViewHelper project.


#### The Code

```java
UrlImageViewHelper.setUrlDrawable(iv, getItem(position), R.drawable.transparent, new UrlImageViewCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onLoaded(ImageView imageView, Bitmap loadedBitmap,
                          String url, boolean loadedFromCache) {
        // only show the animation if it was loaded from network or disk...
        if (!loadedFromCache) {
            ScaleAnimation scale = new ScaleAnimation(0, 1, 0, 1,
                ScaleAnimation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, .5f,
                ScaleAnimation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF, .5f);
            scale.setDuration(140);
            imageView.startAnimation(scale);
        }
    }
});
```
